# Overview

This program taught me a lot more about C++.  What I did was take an original program from one of my labs and set about making it as
fast as I could.  I managed to make it over 1500% faster which was fun and cool.  It took deconstructing for loops to removing if 
statements which made me learn how to read code better and how to write code better in the future.

The purpose of this was to learn how to write better code in the future to optimize performance and time.  It is much faster to write
it well the first time then to have to keep going back to redo it.

# Future Work

* I can add comments to better descibe my changes.
* I can try and get it down to 100ms.
